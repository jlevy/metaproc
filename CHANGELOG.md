# Changelog

All notable user-facing changes are recorded here.

This project uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) while it is in the 0.x
development series.

## [Unreleased][unreleased]

- Prepare the standalone package for its first public release.

### Changed

- Require `softschema>=0.3.0,<0.4` (previously `>=0.1.4,<0.2`). See the
  [softschema 0.2.0](https://github.com/jlevy/softschema/releases/tag/v0.2.0) and
  [softschema 0.3.0](https://github.com/jlevy/softschema/releases/tag/v0.3.0) release
  notes for the complete upstream migration surface.
- `metaproc softschema validate` now includes softschema’s `outcome` discriminator
  (`valid`, `invalid`, or `input_error`) alongside the existing `ok` field.

### Breaking

- `metaproc softschema compile` now requires `--contract CONTRACT_ID`. softschema 0.3
  makes the contract id a required input to `compile_model`, so the sidecar always
  records the contract it was compiled for.
- Softschema 0.2 enforces the contract-id grammar `[namespace:]Name[/version]`. This
  applies to plugin `Contract` registrations, process-spec `schema` fields, artifact
  `softschema.contract` metadata, and the `--schema` and `--contract` CLI options.
  All externally authored IDs must use the new form.
  Metaproc’s structure-report ID is now `metaproc:StructureReport/v1`, renamed from
  `metaproc.structure_report.v1`; the other built-in IDs were already valid.
- Structure reports written by earlier versions no longer validate.
  Regenerate them with `metaproc structure-report`, or update both `softschema.contract`
  and `structure_report.schema` to `metaproc:StructureReport/v1`.
- Softschema 0.3 restricts YAML inputs to bounded, JSON-compatible values.
  Timestamps, aliases and anchors, merge keys, explicit tags, duplicate or non-string
  keys, unsafe integers, negative zero, non-finite numbers, excessive depth, and
  oversized inputs are rejected.
  Quote timestamp-shaped strings and remove YAML-only constructs before validation.
- Compiled schemas are validated offline and remote `$ref` targets are never fetched
  implicitly. Schemas consumed through Metaproc must be self-contained: use local `$defs`
  references or a registered Pydantic model instead of network-resolved references.
